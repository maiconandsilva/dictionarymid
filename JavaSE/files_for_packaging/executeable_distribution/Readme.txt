-= What is DictionaryForMIDs? =-
DictionaryForMIDs is a flexible dictionary that can be set up
with dictionaries for all languages around the world.
For example it is possible to set up (= configure) DictionaryForMIDs
with an English to Spanish dictionary as well as for an 
English to Chinese dictionary. 

DictionaryForMIDs is an open source project and free software
(the GPL license applies). Please note that the dictionaries that are
set up for DictionaryForMIDs may have different copyrights.
All dictionaries that can be downloaded from this site are free to use. 

End users just download a DictionaryForMIDs package with the desired
language and install it on their cell phone or PDA or PC.
Several languages are provided in the section dictionaries for download.
See on the homepage http://dictionarymid.sourceforge.net 


-= Introduction =-
This is the J2SE/PC version of DictionaryForMIDs.
It is different to the J2ME/Mobile version.
The J2SE Version must open a Jar file of the mobile version
including the dictionary. There is no need to setup the J2SE version
with dictionaries!

If no configuration was saved, the program will ask you for a dictionary
saved in a jar or zip file. You can simply choose a file for mobile phones
including the dictionary, which you can download from our homepage.
Now you can select in the "Preferences" menu the right languages for you.

If you want to use an other dictionary, go to the "File" menu,
there you will find the entry "Open Dictionary".

You have one dictionary that you use very often?
Open it, select the right languages for you and click
on "Save Preferences" in the "Preferences" menu.
Now the program will open this dictionary with this settings the next time.

The text fields does have a popup menu for use copy, cut and paste features
without the keyboard. Also the table supports right click to copy the text
of the selected cell to the clipboard. The table also supports sorting.
You can click on the table header to change the sorting.
Thanks goes here to Benjamin Sigg to provide me the SortedTable source.


-= Problems starting a Jar file? =-
Windows: Sometimes some tools like WinZIP/WinRAR register with Jar files.
		 In this case not the program will open after clicking on it.
		 Sometimes it will be enough to deselect the registration of Jar files
		 in your tool. But sometimes you will be forced to re-register
		 the Jar file to this string: javaw -jar "%1"
		 You can also start the program using the console:
		 javaw -jar DictionaryForMIDs.jar
		 
Mac OS X: Here you should get no problems!
		  But make sure that you use Mac OS X, not the version 9.2.2 or older.
		  
Linux: Maybe you must start this program using the terminal:
	   java -jar DictionaryForMIDs.jar


-= System requirements =-
Any OS that runs the Java Standard Edition Runtime version 1.4 or newer.
Needed RAM depends on the size of the dictionary,
but 20 MB free RAM should be enough.
You need a compatible dictionary.


-= License =-
See COPYING.txt


-= Support =-
For any questions visit our new forum: http://dictionarymid.sourceforge.net/forum/


-= Translate DictionaryForMIDs =-
If you want to translate DictionaryForMIDs into other languages than english,
look into the Languages directory. Here you find a file named german.lng.
This is the german translation created by me. Use this as template
to create your translation, you only have to understand english or german :).
Example: You create a spanish translation, then save this file as spanish.lng
         (lowercase please) in the Languages directory.
Now launch DictionaryForMIDs. If you system os language is also spanish,
DictionaryForMIDs should use your translation now.
After you checked your translation, send the translation file to me,
and I try to implement it into the next release.
