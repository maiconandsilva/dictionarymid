====- Fixes for the Current Release -====
⦁Make it possible to download older DfM-Creator versions...
⦁Update French language file
⦁Update the Documentation files (according to the changes in the DfM-Creator GUI).
⦁Create a Windows InoSetup installer that is bundled with JRE.
⦁Create a linux portable version with MakeSelf bundled with JRE.
⦁Create a universal installer version with izPack without JRE.
⦁Create a spash-screen.
⦁Create an icon.

_______This was taken from an email sent to me by Gert Nuber________
⦁In the DictionaryGeneration pane there is "Properties File's directory"; that path is requested again for "edit an existing properties file"
⦁JarCreator: "DictionaryForMIDs.properties and CSV files directory"; well, that is the same as DictionaryGeneration "Destination Directory"
 ⦁"Properties file's directory": maybe it would be better to pick the file DictionaryForMIDs.properties (instead of the directory that contains that file ?)
⦁Can it be that after a run of DictionaryGeneration that the fields in the DictionaryGeneration pane are cleared ?

_______________________________________________________



============- TODOs for the Upcoming Release -=============
-Use a GUI testing framework for DfM-Creator tests




============- Long Term Fixes -============
⦁Bundle custom font file and use it for the DfM-Creator. Why not the Ubuntu font family? It's pretty good!
⦁Translate Documentation files in french.
⦁FIX the nasties introduced by DictdToDictionaryForMIDs while converting a dictionary from freedict.org




===TODOs Implemented Successfully===
⦁The PropertiesEditor's button "Create the Properties File" has been renamed to "Save the Properties File" (overwrites it if it has already been saved)
⦁ A new button "Save Properties File As..." has been added
⦁"Create the Properties File" does not trigger regexp checking so as to make sure the user entered an email address or any other contact information, in the dictionary infoText. That functionality is broken so it's disabled, for now...
⦁The button "Edit existing props file" Has been removed because the DictionaryGeneration panel already has "Edit an Existing Properties File"
⦁The list of languageX postfixes now includes the complete list (founde at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-2_codes)
⦁"Path to the Input CSV file" renamed to "Input CSV file"
BUG FIXES:
    -Gert fixed a bug that prevented the DfM-Creator's JarCreator to load the internal DictionaryForMIDs.jar/jad files while generating jar/jad files.
