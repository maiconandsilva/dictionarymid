I want to report a bug regarding DictionaryForMIDs-Creator 0.6-Beta. When we create a Properties File in tab "Dictionary Generation" at "languageXHasSeparateDictionaryFile" box, the default value as written in the help file is set to "false". So, when I had already saved the properties file I created, which I set that box to "false" for both language 1 and language 2. And then I loaded it again using "Edit an Existing Properies File" in the properties editor, it will set to "true" instead. Then, the effect is you can't make it two-way language translation instead just one-way. P.S: when I edit it (properties file) in the Notepad, the generated jar will work in two-way language as I expected.
⦁Update the Documentation files (according to the changes in the DfM-Creator GUI).
⦁After a run of DictionaryGeneration; clear the fields.
⦁In the DictdToDfM pane, "Output CSV file directory" is also the "input CSV file" in the DictionaryGeneration pane.
⦁In the DictionaryGeneration pane "Properties File" is requested again for "edit an existing properties file".
⦁In the JarCreator pane "DictionaryForMIDs.properties and CSV files directory" is the same as "Destination Directory" in the DictionaryGeneration pane.
⦁In the BitmapFontGenerator pane "Path to Dictionary" is the same as "Destination Director" in the DictionaryGeneration pane.
	POSSIBLE SOLUTION: create an option named "Full Dictionary Creation" and if the user
	selects that option, he will have to set these values up only once.
	The app will behave subtly and will use the output values for one
	command as the input values for others and so forth.

⦁Enable batch convert through text file containing paths/settings for JarCreator (this will be for batch updating the DictionaryForMIDs that are on the webserver, to the latest version)
⦁Bundle custom font file and use it for the DfM-Creator. Why not the Ubuntu font family? It's pretty good!
⦁Create a spash-screen.
⦁Translate Documentation files in french.
⦁Use a GUI testing framework for DfM-Creator tests
⦁FIX the nasties introduced by DictdToDictionaryForMIDs while converting a dictionary from freedict.org
