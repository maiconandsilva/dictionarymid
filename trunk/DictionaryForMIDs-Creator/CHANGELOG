Release: 0.6Beta [12 February, 2013]
====================================

New Features
============

Now, the following can be done with DfM-Creator:

    queue many dictd files to be converted by DictdToDictionaryForMIDs
    queue many csv files to be generated by DictionaryGeneration
    queue many fonts files and font sizes to be created by BitmapFontGenerator
    queue many dictionary files created by DictionaryGeneration, so as to build Jar/Jad files from them, by JarCreator

DfM-Creator generates '.ini' files automatically using the database name and dictionary path entered by the user, if no '.ini' file already exists in the input dictionary directory. DfM-Creator also verifies if the '.dict.dz' -- '.dict' and '.index' files exist before creating the '.ini' files since it will be useless anyway if the files are not there or are not readable.

From the preferences box, it is now possible to choose a locale from among the available ones. The older behaviour was to check the default locale of the system and adjust the locale of DfM-Creator accordingly. However, since DfM-Creator supports only English (U.S.A) and French (France), any other system default locale detected that is different from these, is ignored and the English locale is selected by default.

Empty DictionaryForMIDs.jar/jad are now incorporated inside DfM-Creator. DictionaryForMIDs.jar/jad are compiled and built at DfM-Creator compile time. They are then copied in the directories of DfM-Creator and ant/antenna take care of all the task and the result is a fine DfM-Creator.jar file that comes bundled with DictionaryForMIDs.jar/jad.

The DictionaryForMIDs-Creator PropertiesEditor is now fully able to load a properties file and to make what's necessary (fill the textAreas, the textFields, select/unselect the checkBoxes, select items in ComboBoxes, adjust values in Sliders...) so as to make it possible to directly edit the properties file by taking full advantage of the awesome power of the PropertiesEditor.
