<h1>The BitmapFontGenerator GUI Documentation</h1>
<p>Say you converted a Dictd dictionary file into a CSV file for DictionaryGeneration,<br>
you then generated the dictionary files with DictionaryGeneration (of course). The next<br>
step is to pack the generated files in a some empty DictionaryForMIDs.jar/jad files<br>
to be able to use it on some mobile phone or PDA. Say the dictionary you would like<br>
to install is some Chinese-English dictionary. Say your mobile device does not support<br>
the chinese language (does not know how to display the chinese characters). What you need<br>
is to create bitmap fonts that will be displayed like pictures of the chinese characters<br>
in your mobile device. Fortunately the DictionaryForMIDs project has the BitmapFontGenerator.
</p>

<p>The BitmapFontGenerator tab comes just after the DictionaryGeneration tab and before the<br>
JarCreator's. Let us have an idea of what we need to do to get it generate bitmap fonts for us.<br>
</p>

<p>
You need to:<br>
<ul>
<li>Provide a path to a valid truetype font. This font file will be used to generate the bitmap<br>
fonts for your mobile device. I like the Ubuntu-Font-Family included in Ubuntu from 11.04 on.<br>
they are located in /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ubuntu-font-family. I think they look beautiful :-).</li><br>

<li>Provide the path to the folder named <b>dictionary</b> where your dictionary files are located in.</li>

<li>Choose a font size from the list. You can choose between 8 to 36. Note that the same dictionary<br>
can have many font sizes. For that, you have to select a new size after each font generation and<br>
relaunch a new font generation process by hitting the <b>Start</b> button again.</li><br>

<li>Choose a value in the list provided, between 0 and 4 for the option <b>Clip Top</b>.</li>

<li>Choose a value in the list provided, between 0 and 4 for the option <b>Clip Bottom</b>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
