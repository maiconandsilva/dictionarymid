<h2 class="release-title">Release: 0.6Beta [12 February, 2013]</h2>

<h3 class="category">New Features</h3>

    <p>Now, the following can be done with DfM-Creator:</p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>queue many dictd files to be converted by DictdToDictionaryForMIDs</li>
            <li>queue many csv files to be generated by DictionaryGeneration</li>
            <li>queue many fonts files and font sizes to be created by BitmapFontGenerator</li>
            <li>queue many dictionary files created by DictionaryGeneration, so as to build Jar/Jad files from them, by JarCreator</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>DfM-Creator generates '.ini' files automatically using the database name and dictionary path entered by the user, if no '.ini' file already exists in the input dictionary directory. DfM-Creator also verifies if the '.dict.dz' -- '.dict' and '.index' files exist before creating the '.ini' files since it will be useless anyway if the files are not there or are not readable.</p>

    <p>From the preferences box, it is now possible to choose a locale from among the available ones. The older behaviour was to check the default locale of the system and adjust the locale of DfM-Creator accordingly. However, since DfM-Creator supports only English (U.S.A) and French (France), any other system default locale detected that is different from these, is ignored and the English locale is selected by default.</p>

    <p>Empty DictionaryForMIDs.jar/jad are now incorporated inside DfM-Creator. DictionaryForMIDs.jar/jad are compiled and built at DfM-Creator compile time. They are then copied in the directories of DfM-Creator and ant/antenna take care of all the task and the result is a fine DfM-Creator.jar file that comes bundled with DictionaryForMIDs.jar/jad.</p>

    <p>The DictionaryForMIDs-Creator PropertiesEditor is now fully able to load a properties file and to make what's necessary (fill the textAreas, the textFields, select/unselect the checkBoxes, select items in ComboBoxes, adjust values in Sliders...) so as to make it possible to directly edit the properties file by taking full advantage of the awesome power of the PropertiesEditor.<p>

<h2 class="release-title">Release: 0.5 [25 July, 2012]</h2>

<h3 class="category">New Features</h3>

	<p>NOTE: In the previous versions of <b>DictionaryGeneration</b>, the generated dictionary files
	were put directly in the output directory provided by the user. At that time, the user was asked
	to make sure the output directory's name that she provided is <b><code>dictionary</code></b>. Now,
	<b>DictionaryGeneration</b>,	both the GUI and the command line versions create a directory named
	<b><code>dictionary</code></b> before starting to generate the dictionary files. It is still
	required though, that the user provides an output directory because it is in it that the final output
	directory (<b><code>dictionary</code></b>) is created. For users who automatically set up their
	dictionaries through scripts, adapt your scripts accordingly.</p>
	
	<p>Also note that now even <b>JarCreator</b> has a similar behaviour. In its older versions,
	<b>JarCreator</b> would write the created jar and jad files right in the output directory provided
	by the user, now, it writes them in a directory that it creates just before starting to generate
	the files. The name of the directory depends on the name of the final jar/jad files. Recall that
	<b>JarCreator</b> creates the name of the jar/jad files from the <b>DictionaryForMIDs.properties</b>
	file. If for instance the name of the jar/jad files would be <code>DFM_EngDef_Wordnet.jar</code>
	and <code>DFM_EngDef_Wordnet.jad</code>, then the name of the directory in which the above-mentioned
	jar/jad files will be writen to would also be <b><code>DFM_EngDef_Wordnet</code></b> but without
	the jar/jad extension.</p>
	
	<p>As a final note, keep in mind that both <b>DictionaryGeneration</b> and <b>JarCreator</b>
	need to have the required permissions (i.e read/write permissions especially on UNIX/Linux)
	to be able to create these directories in the location that you provided otherwise and exception
	will be thrown stating that <b>DictionaryGenerator</b> or <b>JarCreator</b> failed to create
	the directory. And if the directories cannot be created, the dictionary-files/jar-jad-files will
	not be generated/written.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Merged the command line versions of DictdToDictionaryForMIDs, DictionaryGeneration,
	BitmapFontGenerator and JarCreator into DfM-Creator.<br><br>
	Its now possible to invoke the CLI versions of the above mentioned tools
	from the command line by calling DfM-Creator in either of the following forms:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>java -jar DfM-Creator-XX-XXXX.jar [--DictdToDictionaryForMIDs] [-dc]</li>
			<li>java -jar DfM-Creator-XX-XXXX.jar [--DictionaryGeneration] [-dg] INPUT_DICTIONARY_FILE OUTPUT_DIRECTORY PROPERTY_DIRECTORY</li>
			<li>java -jar DfM-Creator-XX-XXXX.jar [--JarCreator] [-fg] DICTIONARY_DIRECTORY EMPTY_JAR_DIRECTORY OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</li>
			<li>java -jar DfM-Creator-XX-XXXX.jar [--FontGenerator] [-jc]</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<p>P.S: DfM-Creator-XX-XXXX.jar is for DfM-Creator-VERSION-VERSION_STATUS.jar. For instance DfM-Creator-06-Beta</p>
	
</ul>

<h2 class="release-title">Release: 0.4 [29 June, 2012]</h2>
<p>First official DfM-Creator release</p>

<h3 class="category">Major Implemented Features:</h3>
<ul>
	<b>Now you can graphically:</b>
	<li>Convert a Dictd file into the DictionaryForMIDs format</li>
	<br>
	<li>Generate dictionary files from the input file either provided by
		 DictdToDictionaryForMIDs or manually created from Microsoft's Excel or
		 OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice's Calc
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>Pack the generated dictionary files in some empty DictionaryForMIDs
		 Jar/Jad files
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>Create a DictionaryForMIDs.properties file with both the <b>PropertiesEditor</b>
		 and the <b>ContentProperties-Creator</b> in an easy and pleasant way.
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>Edit an existing DictionaryForMIDs.properties file in order to adapt it,
	for instance, to another dictionary file.</li>
	<br>
	<li>Check the integrity of an existing CSV file (the input file for DictionaryGeneration)
	</li>
	<br>
</ul>

<h3 class="category">Known Bugs:</h3>
<p>There is a known bug related to the dictionary conversion (Bug-09062012).
It happens during the conversion of some freedict.org bilingual dictionaries.
The bug causes DictdToDictionaryForMIDs to write in the converted dictionary file
a line like the following:
</p>
<p><i>&lt;pre&gt;	java.lang.NullPointerException at org.dict.kernel.Database.readAll(Database.java:395)
at org.dict.kernel.Database.defineMatch(Database.java:52) at org.dict.kernel.DictEngine.defineMatch(DictEngine.java:72)
at org.dict.kernel.DictEngine.lookup(DictEngine.java:149) (...) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:722)
\n\nAvailable dictionaries: freedict-eng-fra&lt;/pre&gt;</i>
</p>
<p>
Hopefully the causes of this bug will be discovered and then the bug will be fixed.
Hopefully this will be done in a future version of DictionaryForMIDs-Creator.
For the time being, the only way to get rid of those nasties is to edit the converted file manually.
So, if your input dictionary file is from freedict.org (is a freedict dictionary), open the converted
file and remove the line starting from <i>&lt;pre&gt;</i> to <i>&lt;/pre&gt;</i> along with all the text
between them. Be careful not to delete some text that actually belong to the dictionary.
