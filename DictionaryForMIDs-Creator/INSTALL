Building the tools and applications with build.xml

Due to the complexity of DictionaryForMIDs-Creator, the only supported build
method is through the use of either the build.xml file that in under the
directory trunk/Build or the one that is specific to DfM-Creator; that one
in located in trunk/DictionaryForMIDs-Creator/DfM-Creator-Build.
Its name is also build.xml.

You must have Apache-Ant and Antenna (preferably the latest versions).
Antenna is already present in the above mentioned 2 build directories.

Before proceeding to the build, you must:

    Let the file build.xml in its build directory
    Have Oracle Java JDK-7u2 or later (can be downloaded somewhere at:
    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
    Have Oracle Java ME SDK 3.0 installed or Sun Java Wireless Toolkit 2.5.2
    (can be downloaded somewhere at:
    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javame/javamobile/download/sdk/index.html)
    Set wtk.home to your WTK installation directory
    Have Apache Ant installed on your system (in the PATH)
    Have antenna-bin-xxx.jar in the build directory (build directory has a version
    of antenna but it is most of the time outdated.)

Important note: the source files are UTF-8 encoded. If you are using the old Sun WTK (for versions <= 2.5.2), you must set in the file ktools.properties (found somewhere under wtklib) the following property:
javac.encoding=UTF-8

-Install subversion on your computer
-Check out the whole source tree from the DictionaryForMIDs subversion repository

code:
    svn co https://dictionarymid.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/dictionarymid dictionarymid

Edit Build/build.xml and change 
<property name="wtk.home"  location="D:\WTK25"/>
to the corrrect path

$ cd Build
$ ant

now, Build directory will contain the compiled binaries of all the sources.
