====- Fixes for the Current Release -====
⦁Make it possible to download older DfM-Creator versions...
⦁Update French language file
⦁Update the Documentation files (according to the changes in the DfM-Creator GUI).
⦁Create a Windows InoSetup installer that is bundled with JRE.
⦁Create a linux portable version with MakeSelf bundled with JRE.
⦁Create a universal installer version with izPack without JRE.
⦁Create a spash-screen.
⦁Create an icon.

_______This was taken from an email sent to me by Gert Nuber________
⦁The properties editor has the button "create the properties file"; that may better read now "save properties file"; Possibly with two buttons: "save properties file" (i.e. overwrite existing) and "save properties file under" (new location)"
⦁The button "Edit existing props file" in the property editor seems to me superflous, because the DictionaryGeneration pane alreads has "Edit an Existing Properties File"
⦁Minor: the list of file postfixes: would it be an option to include the complete list at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-2_codes ?
⦁In the DictionaryGeneration pane there is "Properties File's directory"; well, that path is requested again for "edit an existing properties file"
⦁About the naming: 
        ⦁"Path to the Input CSV file": this includes the filename (not only the path); maybe "Input CSV file" would be better ?
        ⦁"Properties file's directory": hmmm, maybe it would be better to pick the file DictionaryForMIDs.properties (instead of the directory that contains that file ?)
⦁Can it be that after a run of DictionaryGeneration that the fields in the DictionaryGeneration pane are cleared ?
⦁JarCreator: "DictionaryForMIDs.properties and CSV files directory"; well, that is the same as DictionaryGeneration "Destination Directory"
⦁JarCreator: did throw a NullPointerException on my test. Hmmm, I will check on that.
